# This is a sampler for constraint Wishart distributions based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
# For any questions or comments please refer to alexander.buchholz@ensae.fr
# We sample from Wishart distributions based on their Cholesky and eigenvalue decomposition.
# Arising hyper-parameters are adaptively tuned via Bayesian optimization
